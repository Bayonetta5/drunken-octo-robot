This is directory of Panda3D utilities used in the translation to C++ of the 
python program samples. Most are based on their python counterpart but only
the minimal set of features gets implemented.

Developped on a GNU/Linux Ubuntu distribution, using Eclipse as IDE and 
Panda3d 1.7 as a framework.

The main objective of this work is for me to learn about Panda3d, C++ and 3d 
games in general. As such, it aims at being C++ programs while remaining 
close to the original python scripts. I hope you find it helpful and of course,
constructive critics are always welcome.
