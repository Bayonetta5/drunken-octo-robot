This is a python to C++ translation of Panda3d sample/tutorials:
Tut-Step-1-Blank-Window.py
Tut-Step-2-Basic-Setup.py 
Tut-Step-3-Load-Model.py 
Tut-Step-4-Load-System.py 
Tut-Step-5-Complete-Solar-System.py 
Tut-Step-6-Controllable-System.py

Developped on a GNU/Linux Ubuntu distribution, using Eclipse as IDE and 
Panda3d 1.7 as a framework.

The main objective of this work is for me to learn about Panda3d, C++ and 3d 
games in general. Has such, it aims at being a C++ program while remaining 
close to the original python script. I hope you find it helpful and of course,
constructive critics are always welcome.
